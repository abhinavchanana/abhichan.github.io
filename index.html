            <h3>Developed a new Data Augmentation Technique: Aug-CutMix - (Prof. Pascal Poupart)</h3>
            <p>Combined both the CutMix (ICML 2016) and AugMix(ICML 2020) algorithms which are state of the art for data augmentation technique developed by DeepMind at Google and UC-Berkeley. The aim of the project was to compare the performance of the new algorithm which is a mixture of AugMix and CutMix vs Augmix vs CutMix. We had used the augmentation network from the AugMix and mixing of images from CutMix. This led to an algorithm which made the models more robust and tolerant to noise.</p>

            <h3>AutoArticle: Automated Article Generation - (Prof. Ali Ghodsi)</h3>
            <p>Developed a tool which used AI techniques like Transforms for generating images and GAN’s for text captioning or headline generation. The aim of the project was to develop a novel transformer model for text summarization for text abstraction and implementation of the CP-GAN’s for generating an image for the article. This tool generated images for paragraphs using CP-GAN, looks up on google images and suggests Headlines using Transformers.</p>

            <h3>BasicQueue: A Simple Message Broker Queue</h3>
            <p>Developed a basic queue which was implemented using Node.Js on the concepts of Producer-consumer problem. It the items could be inserted and retrieved from the queue using RESTAPI’s. I had used this queue for many projects as interfacing using REST API for any language is relatively easy when compared to packages. The queue had basic functionalities like timeout, heartbeat.</p>

            <h3>SeizureBuddy: Prediction of Seizure Attacks for Epilepsy Patients -(Microsoft Internship Program, India)</h3>
            <p>Created a real-time application which used to take input from the IEEG device and predict if the patient will seize based on the data. We were able to predict the seizure in the range of 2 – 5 min with AUC score of 0.88. The application was a .Net application and the algorithm was developed in python using random tree classifier and deployed on the azure environment.</p>
